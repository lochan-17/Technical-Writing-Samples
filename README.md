# LOCHAN | Technical Documentation Specialist (Solana & Web3)

## 🚀 About Me
I specialize in **AI-Native Technical Writing**, bridging the gap between complex blockchain architecture and developer adoption. Using a hybrid workflow powered by **Gemini Pro**, I produce high-accuracy documentation 10x faster than traditional methods.

* **The Mission:** To help Web3 protocols reduce support tickets and increase developer retention through world-class documentation.
* **The Method:** Human-led technical strategy + AI-accelerated execution.
